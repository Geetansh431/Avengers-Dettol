                Origin Story:
The Hulk's alter ego is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who was exposed to gamma radiation during the detonation of an experimental bomb he created. As a result, whenever Banner becomes angry or stressed, he transforms into the Hulk, a massive green-skinned humanoid possessing incredible strength and resilience.

                Alter Egos:
                Aside from his Hulk form, Banner has multiple alternate personas within his psyche, including the Gray Hulk (also known as Joe Fixit), the Savage Hulk (often seen as the most common and iconic version), the intelligent Professor Hulk, the childlike and emotionally vulnerable Green Scar, and the cunning and brutal Worldbreaker Hulk, among others.

                Throughout "Endgame," Bruce Banner has merged his intellect with the Hulk's immense strength, creating a new persona often referred to as "Smart Hulk" or "Professor Hulk." This version of the Hulk is both intelligent and calm, possessing Banner's intellect and the Hulk's physical prowess.
