                In Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder, associated with strength, thunderstorms, oak trees, and protection of mankind. He is the son of Odin, the chief god, and Jord, the personification of the Earth. Thor is depicted as a powerful warrior who wields the hammer Mjolnir, which is enchanted to return to his hand when thrown and capable of producing lightning. He travels in a chariot drawn by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str.

The relationship between Thor and Loki is one of the most compelling dynamics in both Norse mythology and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Their bond is complex, marked by a mix of loyalty, rivalry, love, and betrayal. Here's an overview of their brotherhood in both contexts:

Norse Mythology:

In Norse mythology, Thor and Loki are depicted as adoptive brothers, with Loki being the son of the giant Laufey. Despite their differences in personality and temperament, they often work together as members of the Norse pantheon. However, Loki's cunning and trickery frequently lead to conflicts and betrayals that strain their relationship. For example, Loki engineers the death of Thor's beloved servant, Sif, leading to Thor's wrath. Nevertheless, the two gods also share moments of camaraderie and cooperation, particularly when facing external threats such as the giants or the serpent Jormungandr.

                In "Avengers: Endgame," Thor plays a significant role as one of the core members of the Avengers. The film picks up after the devastating events of "Avengers: Infinity War," where Thanos succeeded in his plan to wipe out half of all life in the universe with the snap of his fingers.
